            <h1>Great ideas happen when we come together</h1>

            <p>We worked with artists to create unique works of art that visualize collaboration and the great ideas
                that happen when we build something together. We’re calling it The Canvas Project.</p>
            <p>And should your collaborators be halfway around the world, you can now pick one of these artworks to set
                the backdrop for your next get-together over </p>

            <h1>Meet the artists</h1>
            <p>Influenced by the power of collaboration and connection these artists created both photographic and
                illustrative wallpapers for the Meet experience.
